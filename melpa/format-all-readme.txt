Lets you auto-format source code in several languages using the
same command for all languages, instead of learning a different
elisp package and formatting command for each language.

Just do M-x `format-all-buffer' and it will try its best to do the
right thing.

For most languages, you will need to install an external program to
help with the formatting.  If you don't have the right program,
`format-all-buffer' will try to tell you how to install it.
