;; URL: https://github.com/abingham/traad
;; Package-Requires: ((dash "2.13.0") (deferred "0.3.2") (popup "0.5.0") (request "0.2.0") (request-deferred "0.2.0") (virtualenvwrapper "20151123") (f "0.20.0"))

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Description:
;;
;; traad is a JSON+HTTP server built around the rope refactoring library. This
;; file provides an API for talking to that server - and thus to rope - from
;; emacs lisp. Or, put another way, it's another way to use rope from emacs.
;;
;; For more details, see the project page at
;; https://github.com/abingham/traad.
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; Copy traad.el to some location in your emacs load path. Then add
;; "(require 'traad)" to your emacs initialization (.emacs,
;; init.el, or something).
;;
;; Example config:
;;
;;   (require 'traad)

(defun traad-rename (new-name)
  "Rename the object at the current location.

Attempts to rename all occurrences of the object in the project.

Note that this will avoid renaming certain occurrences, as
follows:

  - Occurrences in comments/docstrings will not be renamed. For
    example, let's say we're renaming a variable,
    `var_to_rename`:

    | var_to_rename = 'this is a string'                 # [1]
    |
    | some_variable = var_to_rename                      # [2]
    |
    | # This is an occurrence of `var-to-rename`         # [3]
    |
    | def some_function(input_var):
    |     '''Docstring that has `var_to_rename` in it.'''# [4]
    |     return input_var ** 2
    |
    | some_function(var_to_rename)                       # [5]

    Renaming `var_to_rename` to `new_var_name`, this would
    become:

    | new_var_name = 'this is a string'                  # [1]
    |
    | some_variable = new_var_name                       # [2]
    |
    | # This is an occurrence of `var-to-rename`         # [3]
    |
    | def some_function(input_var):
    |     '''Docstring that has `var_to_rename` in it.'''# [4]
    |     return input_var ** 2
    |
    | some_function(new_var_name)                        # [5]

    Note that [1], [2] & [5] were renamed, but [3] &
    [4] (occurrences in a comment and a docstring) were not
    renamed.

  - Occurrences higher and lower in the hierarchy (i.e. the
    same method in a subclass or superclass) will not be renamed.
    For example, let's say you're renaming some method,
    `method_to_rename`:

    | class BaseClass(object):
    |     def method_to_rename():                        # [1]
    |         print('This is the super class.')
    |
    | class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    |     def method_to_rename():                        # [2]
    |         print('This is the derived class.')

    Renaming `BaseClass.method_to_rename` to
    `BaseClass.new_name`, results in:

    | class BaseClass(object):
    |     def new_name():                                # [1]
    |         print('This is the super class.')
    |
    | class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    |     def method_to_rename():                        # [2]
    |         print('This is the derived class.')

    The original method, [1], is renamed. Note that the override
    method in the subclass, [2], does not get renamed.

  - Unsure occurrences will not be renamed. Rope may find
    occurrences that it is unsure about, which are marked as
    `unsure`. These will generally be wrong, so you don't want to
    include them all. However, this means you may miss some
    occurrences of the object. See the Rope documentation for
    more details on the `unsure` parameter.

Calling `traad-normalize-arguments' on `this_is_a_test`, it would

    | this_is_a_test('a', 'b', 'c')
    | this_is_a_test('a', 'b')

Note that the arguments in [1] were reordered. A more complex
case would be:

    |     return [a, b, c, d]
    |
    | longer_function('a', 'b', d='d')

It cannot remove the keyword reference to `d`, so \"d='d'\" is
retained.

  "Remove the `INDEX'th argument from the signature at point.

Also attempts to remove it from any calls to this function.

For example, let's say we have the following:

It has removed the third argument, `arg3`.

Note:

  - The index counts from zero, so an index of 0 means the first
    argument and an index of 2 means the _third_ argument.

  - It does not remove internal references to the argument (e.g.
    [1]) in the function logic.

  - References to the function also have their function call
    normalised. See [2], where the explicit keyword reference was
    removed in favour of a positional reference. See

  "Add a new argument at `INDEX' in the signature at point.

Takes the following arguments:

  `INDEX'   - The index to add the argument at. Note that this
              is zero-indexed, so an index of 1 will insert it
              as the _second_ argument.
  `NAME'    - The name of the argument.
  `DEFAULT' - The default value of the argument.
  `VALUE'   - The value to insert for this argument in any
              existing calls to this function.

For example, let's say we have the following:

    | def some_function(arg1, arg2, arg3=10, arg4='some string'):
    |     return [arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4]
    |
    | some_function(1, 2, arg3=3, arg4='four')

Let's call `traad-add-argument' on some_function. We'll supply
the following arguments:

`INDEX'   = 3
`NAME'    = \"new_arg\"
`DEFAULT' = 30
`VALUE'   = 50

This will become:

    | def some_function(arg1, arg2, arg3=10, new_arg=30, arg4='some string'):

    |
    | some_function(1, 2, 3, 50, 'four')                 # [1]

Note that references to the function also have their function
call normalised. See [1], where the explicit keyword reference
was removed in favour of a positional reference. See
`traad-normalize-arguments' for more information.

Arguments are always added as keyword arguments. Rope does not
discriminate based on position, so you can add keyword arguments
out-of-order. For example, back to the original function:

    | def some_function(arg1, arg2, arg3=10, arg4='some string'):
    |     return [arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4]
    |
    | some_function(1, 2, arg3=3, arg4='four')

Adding the same argument as before at `INDEX' = 1, this will
become:

    | def some_function(arg1, new_arg=30, arg2, arg3=10, arg4='some string'):# [1]
    |     return [arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4]
    |
    | some_function(1, 50, 2, 3, 'four')

Watch line [1]. Note that the sequence argument `arg2` now
appears after `new_arg`, a keyword argument, so the function
signature is no longer valid.

(defun traad-inline ()
  "Inline this object (replace the object with the thing it represents.)

Inlining can be performed on many objects.

Functions:

  Inlining a function replaces calls to a function with the
  explicit code the function executes. For example:

    | def do_something():
    |     print sys.version
    |     return C()

  Inlining `do_something`, becomes:

    | print sys.version
    | return C()

  Methods, etc. can also be inlined. For example:

    | class C(object):
    |     var = 1
    |
    |     def f(self, p):                                # [1]
    |         result = self.var + pn                     # [1]
    |         return result                              # [1]
    |

    | x = c.f(1)                                         # [2]

  Inlining `C.f`, becomes:

    | class C(object):
    |     var = 1
    |
    | c = C()
    | result = c.var + pn                                # [2]
    | x = result                                         # [2]

Parameters:

  Inlning a parameter passes the default value of a keyword
  parameter whenever the parameter is not explicitly referenced.
  For example:

    | def f(p1=1, p2=2):
    |     pass
    |
    | f(3, 2)
    | f()                                                # [1]
    | f(3)                                               # [2]
    | f(p1=5, p2=7)                                      # [3]

  Inlining `p2`, becomes:

    | def f(p1=1, p2=2):
    |     pass
    |
    | f(3, 2)
    | f(p2=2)                                            # [1]
    | f(3, 2)                                            # [2]
    | f(5, 7)                                            # [3]

[1] and [2] have had explicit calls to the keyword argument
added. Note that:

  - It prefers positional over keyword calls.

  - It also normalizes the arguments, so [3] is affected. See
    `traad-normalize-arguments' for more information.

  Expanding star imports in 'mod2.py' gives:

    |
    | my_var = some_function()

Note that it treats the new assignment of my_var as though it is
creating a variable local to 'mod2.py'.
