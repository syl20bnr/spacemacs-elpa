MPDel is an Emacs client for Music Player Daemon (MPD), a flexible,
powerful, server-side application for playing music.  This file
makes features (e.g., playlist, navigation and playback) provided
by other files in the project accessible globally through the
global minor mode `mpdel-mode'.  This file is also responsible for
integrating the features together to provide a seamless experience
(see `mpdel-setup').
